    <h3 id="Rate_Songs">1. Rate Songs</h3>

    <p>You will be able to rate your favorite (or not so favorite) songs on
        a scale from 0-10 out of 10, and then leave a review for others to view
        as to why you gave it the rating you did.
    </p>


    <h3 id="Log_in">2. Log into Personal Account</h3>

    <p>You will be able to log into your own personal account using your own
        personally generated username and password. From this account you will be
        able to leave your own reviews instead of just viewing others!
    </p>


    <h3 id="Search">3. Search for ratings of your favorite songs</h3>

    <p> You will be able to search the title of your favorite songs and bring up the
        reviews and ratings that have been left on it.
    </p>


    <h3 id="Check">4. Check out your past reviews</h3>

    <p> From your personal account you will be able to view and edit your own past
        reviews of songs!
    </p>


    <h3 id="App">5. Mobile App</h3>

    <p>Our site will also eventually be available to download on Apple and Android
        products in the form as an app in their respective app store!
